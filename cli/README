requires libwebsockets, ncurses and libssl-dev

To Play:

	2: run make
	3: ./cli

Upon opening the Command Line Interface you will be prompted to login or register an account.
You must be logged into an account to be able to play against other users.

There are currently 2 options for games to play: "snake" or "pong".
These options will be presented to you after you login.
Once you press the number corresponding to the game of your choice you will begin finding a match.
When a match is found the game will start immediately.

Snake functions identically to the web version, use the 'WASD' keys to change direction.
Pick up food represented by an 'x' and avoid crashing into your opponent.

Pong is almost identical to the web version however it is (nearly) impossible to track key-down and key-up events in the terminal.
So for this reason when you press 'W' or 'S' to move your paddle up or down respectively, you must press either key again to stop the paddle.

That is all, have fun playing :)
